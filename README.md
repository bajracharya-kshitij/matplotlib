Exploring matplotlib while solving problems

In this repository, we explore the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna">Lenna image</a> and the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data">Global Temperature Change dataset</a> to learn the 
basics of matplotlib. We'll be solving the following problems here.

<h3>Problem 1</h3>

The Lenna image is a widely used test image in image processing. <br/>
a) Find the reason behind its widespread use. Investigate what's so special about it. <br/>
b) Create a stacked histogram for RGB values of the image. <br/>
c) Represent RGB values of pixel at (50,100) in a pie-chart. <br/>
d) Represent RGB values of pixel at (100,100) in a pie-chart. What's unusual about this pixel? <br/>
e) Generate a negative for this image.<br/>


<h3>Problem 2</h3>

Given the GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry dataset, use the data between the period of 1960 and 2009 inclusive to <br/>
a) display the annual temperatures of Nepal <br/>
b) compare the annual temperatures of the US, the UK and China <br/>
c) find the mean and the range of temperatures from (b)
